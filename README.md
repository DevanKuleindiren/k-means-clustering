k-means-clustering
==================

##Introduction
This is my implementation of k-means clustering. These classes generate random 2D data points (2D so that they can be visualised!) with a higher probability of being generated in specific regions.
There are 3 regions where the datapoints have a higher probability of being generated, which in effect creates 3 clusters of data points.
The kMeans class then attempts to assign cluster centers (marked in black) to these clusters.
